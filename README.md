HNG Stage 0 – Frontend Wizards Profile Card

This is my Stage 0 task for the HNG 2025 Frontend.  
The goal is to build a small, semantic, and responsive Profile Card component using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following accessibility and testing requirements.

---

Requirements
The profile card includes:
- Name — `data-testid="test-user-name"`
- Short bio — `data-testid="test-user-bio"`
- Current time (in milliseconds) — `data-testid="test-user-time"`
- Avatar image — `data-testid="test-user-avatar"`
- Social links — `data-testid="test-user-social-links"`
- Hobbies — `data-testid="test-user-hobbies"`
- Dislikes — `data-testid="test-user-dislikes"`

All elements follow semantic HTML and are keyboard accessible.

Tech Stack
- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3 (Flexbox + responsive layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (for dynamic time)
